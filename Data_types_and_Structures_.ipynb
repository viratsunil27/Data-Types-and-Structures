        "\n",
        "- Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. They define the relationship between the data and the operations that can be performed on them.\n",

        "3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- Both lists and tuples are used to store collections of items in Python, but main differnrce is mutability, syntax, performance, use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Describe how dictionaries store data\n",
        "\n",
        "- A dictionary in Python is a built in data structure that stores key value pairs. It is unordered, mutable, and allows for fast lookups using keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- Both sets and lists are used to store collections but they serve different purposes. we might choose a set over a list when we need certain behaviors that only sets provide.\n",

        "Sets automatically remove duplicates.\n",
        "Sets are unordered so if order doesn’t matter, sets are more efficient.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- Python lists can contain different data types in a single list.\n",

        "- Python is a dynamically typed language which means its data structures including list are flexible and it is not require all elements to be of the same type.\n",

        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python strings are immutable which means once a string is created it cannot be changed. Any operation that seems to modify a string actually creates a new one.\n",
